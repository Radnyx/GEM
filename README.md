# GEM
Gameboy Emulator (2015)

Features:

* Includes debugger to disassemble and step through assembly instructions and a memory inspector.

* Supports basic TAS (Tool-Assisted-Speedrun) input playback, but generally desyncs after a few minutes.

Future work:

* Since `0xCB` extension opcodes are uncommon, they have only been implemented on a per need basis.
* Proper bank switching.
